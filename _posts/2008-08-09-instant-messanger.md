excerpt: |
  PIMP is a client server Instant Messenger based on an XML protocol. The application is a composition of two independent components; a server written in Python
  and client based on Java platform. The two parts are communicating with each other using a PIMP protocol version 2. The client was created as a final project for GUI Programming course while the server was realized as an independent module when I learny Python. Below you can find more information about the client, server and protocol used.
